# Data is Better Together

Data is Better Together is a collab between ü§ó Hugging Face, üèì Argilla, and the Open Source ML community. Our goal is to empower the open source community to collectively build impactful datasets. 

## What have we done so far?

The community has created a dataset of 10k prompts [DIBT/10k_prompts_ranked](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DIBT/10k_prompts_ranked) ranked by quality as part of Data is Better Together.

## What are currently working on?

We are working on several strands of work. Here are current active projects.

### 1. Prompt ranking

Our first DIBT activity is focused on ranking the quality of prompts. We have already released version 1.0 of this dataset [DIBT/10k_prompts_ranked](https://huggingface.co/datasets/DIBT/10k_prompts_ranked). So far over 385 people have contributed annotations to this dataset but we are continuing to collect more annotations!

- Follow the progress of this effort in this [dashboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/DIBT/prompt-collective-dashboard)
- You can contribute to the ranking of prompts [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/DIBT/prompt-collective)

### 2. Multilingual Prompt Evaluation Project (MPEP)

There are not enough language-specific benchmarks for open LLMs! We want to create a leaderboard for more languages by leveraging the community! You can find more information about this project in the [MPEP README](prompt_translation/README.md).

### 3. Creating a dashboard for tracking the translation efforts

Once you have your annotation suite running on a Hugging Face Space, you can easily set up a dashboard to track the annotation effort. Follow the steps in [`03_create_dashboard.ipynb`](./prompt_translation/03_create_dashboard.ipynb) to set up one for the language you are working on.

You can also check the status of all translation efforts in our [Multilingual Dashboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/DIBT/PromptTranslationMultilingualDashboard).
