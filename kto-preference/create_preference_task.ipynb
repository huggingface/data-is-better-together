    "In this example we'll focus on a dataset containing prompts and responses focused on generating Haiku. The approach could be applied to any dataset where you want to collect human ratings for a set of prompts and responses.

And decades later, it served as Rinkert’s portal to the past inside the California Academy of Sciences. Information gleaned from such nests, woven long ago from species in plant communities called transitional habitat, could help restore the shoreline in the future. Transitional habitat has nearly disappeared from the San Francisco Bay, and scientists need a clearer picture of its original species composition—which was never properly documented. With that insight, conservation research groups like the San Francisco Bay Bird Observatory can help guide best practices when restoring the native habitat that has long served as critical refuge for imperiled birds and animals as adjacent marshes flood more with rising sea levels. “We can’t ask restoration ecologists to plant nonnative species or to just take their best guess and throw things out there,” says Rinkert.\",\n",
